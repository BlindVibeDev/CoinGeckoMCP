# CoinGecko API Server MCP Implementation Summary

## What We've Done

We have successfully implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 support for the CoinGecko API Server, allowing it to function as an MCP component for AI systems like Claude. This implementation includes:

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Endpoint**
   - Created a standard-compliant `/rpc` endpoint
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Supported all required parameters

2. **MCP Schema Definition**
   - Defined a schema at `/mcp/schema` that follows the MCP specification
   - Documented all tools and parameters
   - Included clear descriptions and return types

3. **Method Implementation**
   - Ping - Basic server status check
   - Price data - Get cryptocurrency prices
   - Market data - Get detailed market information
   - Trending coins - Get popular cryptocurrencies
   - Global data - Get market-wide statistics
   - Currency support - Get supported currencies

4. **Documentation**
   - Created step-by-step guides
   - Provided examples for all methods
   - Added troubleshooting information

## Connecting Claude Desktop

To use the CoinGecko API Server with Claude Desktop:

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Connect Claude Desktop**
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings > MCP
   - Add a new component with the URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Claude should discover the available tools automatically

3. **Using the Tools**
   Claude can now perform tasks like:
   - Get current cryptocurrency prices
   - Search for trending coins
   - Check global market statistics
   - Compare prices across currencies

## Example Claude Prompts

Here are some example prompts to use with Claude once connected:

- "What's the current price of Bitcoin in USD and EUR?"
- "Which cryptocurrencies are trending right now?"
- "Compare the market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum."
- "What are the supported currency pairs for price conversion?"
- "Show me the global cryptocurrency market data."

## Testing

You can verify the implementation works correctly by running:

```bash
npm run test-mcp
```

This will test the MCP endpoints and confirm they're functioning properly.
